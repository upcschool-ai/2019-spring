Dropout, applied to a layer, consists of randomly \"dropping out\" (i.e. setting to zero) a number of \n","output features of the layer during training. Let's say a given layer would normally have returned a vector `[0.2, 0.5, 1.3, 0.8, 1.1]` for a \n","given input sample during training; after applying dropout, this vector will have a few zero entries distributed at random, e.g. `[0, 0.5, \n","1.3, 0, 1.1]`. The \"dropout rate\" is the fraction of the features that are being zeroed-out; it is usually set between 0.2 and 0.5. At test \n","time, no units are dropped out, and instead the layer's output values are scaled down by a factor equal to the dropout rate, so as to \n","balance for the fact that more units are active than at training time.\n","\n","This technique may seem strange and arbitrary.
